**Open your terminal and run this code:**
<br>
```chmod +x run_script.sh```
<br><br>
**What the script does are:**
1. Read data from csv file
2. Ingest data and audit the time spent
3. Concatenate data from multiple loads
4. Transform data by drop duplicate and changing date column to have date format (M/d/yyy)
5. Data Mart
6. Export all table to parquet file (*this part is still not functioning*)

This directory didn't include the test class due to my limited time and I haven't done a test class before, so I might spend a lot of time on it
<br>
**Thank you**
